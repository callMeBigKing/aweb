                                                        extant body of literature has analyzed the impact of various
                                                        negotiator characteristics on negotiation processes and
                                                        outcomes. Amongst others, the gender of negotiators has been
                                                        identified as an important variable. A common approach to study
                                                        gender differences in negotiation is to include the variable
                                                        “sex” into research designs and statistical models. In such

                                                        negotiation behavior and in reached outcomes seemingly confirm
                                                        stereotypical gender roles: men tend to more often initialize
                                                        negotiations, they interpret interactions more strategically
                                                        than women, and they tend to focus more on legalistic arguments
                                                        like common practices and economic aspects. Most important, they
                                                        tend to reach better substantive (individual) outcomes than
                                                        women. In contrast, female negotiators tend be more risk averse,
                                                        focus more on relational aspects in conflict resolution and
                                                        engage in more cooperative negotiation behavior. Female
                                                        negotiators – when amongst them - tend to reach better joint
                                                        outcomes. More recently, a critical evaluation of these
                                                        stereotypical findings has come up with a more differentiated
                                                        picture: a meta-analysis by Mazei et al. 2015 shows that gender
                                                        differences in outcomes are diminishing or even reversed with

                                                        agreements (i.e. the reduction of structural ambiguity), (iii)
                                                        when women are negotiating as constituents (i.e. for someone
                                                        else), (iv) when there is an integrative potential in the
                                                        negotiation problem, and (v) when women initiated negotiation
